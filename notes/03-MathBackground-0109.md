## Proof

### Deduction

### Induction

1. Show the statement is true for a base case. (Base case is the smallest case that the statement is true.)
2. Use the statement to prove that, if it is true for n, then it is true for n+1. (Inductive step)

#### What if the base case is false?

Even if there are ways to prove the statement with induction, but if can't prove the base case or can't find a base case that the statement is true, then there is no way to start the induction.

#### Strong Induction

When proving n+1, instead of only assuming that n is true, we assume that all the previous cases are true (n-1, n-2, n-3, ... 1, 0) and then prove that n+1 is true.

With strong induction, we have more power to prove the statement.

### Proof by Contradiction

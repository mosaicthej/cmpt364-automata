# Nondeterministic Finite Automata

Being able to be in multiple states simultaneously

Sometimes, can be expressed as an NFA "guessing" which state to take

## Example

Want to accept the language of all words over {0, 1} that contain the substring 101

What does this look like as a DFA?

```svg
<!-- DFA solution -->
```

### Solution with NFA

Does there exist some sequence of states reading the input string that ends in a state that accepts?

```svg
<!-- NFA graph -->
```

Consider the word 0110101

What are all possible paths on this word?

```svg
<!-- Tree for the procedure -->
```

## NFA to DFA

NFA can be converted to a DFA by taking the powerset of the set of states

## Definition

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Definition:} \\
\text{A nondeterministic finite automaton is a 5-tuple } \\
M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, \delta, F)\\
\text{where:} \\
Q \text{ is a finite set of states} \\
\Sigma \text{ is a finite set of input symbols} \\
q_0 \in Q \text{ is the start state} \\
\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow 2^Q \text{ is the transition function} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Given a state $q \in Q$ and an input symbol $a \in \Sigma$, $\delta(q, a)$ is the set of states that we can reach from $q$ on input $a$

Everything else is the same as DFA
